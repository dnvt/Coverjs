# Coverjs
Covers is an experiment we made together with Lucas Matholaz and Fran√ßois Denavaut back in 2011. We created css or canvas versions of albums artworks, so we can animate them in real-time with the music. It uses beatdetektor.js (or even just the Web Audio API) to analyze the sound and animate the cover (Chrome only).
